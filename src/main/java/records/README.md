    Records:

    - record of immutable values
    - final classes
    - can not be extended
    - has default getters, constructor, hashcode
    - can't add instance fields
    - static variables are ok
    - modify the default/canonical constructor to make deep copy
    - unlike classes, it runs the canonical constructor during deserialization
    - any additional constructor should call the cannonical constructor
